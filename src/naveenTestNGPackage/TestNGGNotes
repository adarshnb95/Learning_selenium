Install testNG in eclipse
https://testng.org/testng-eclipse-update-site


Parameterized tests:

in testng.xml file where we can run the tests we want to run, we can also pass parameters. Parameters are more like env variables which allow
us to work with multiple test cases with same env variables.

Data driven: from diff resources
-- excel file - test data
-- properties file - Env variables, Object repos, test data
-- testng.xml - Env variables, do not store test data (not good practice)
-- Other xml files // remaining 3 can also be used to store test data
-- JSON files
-- DB
